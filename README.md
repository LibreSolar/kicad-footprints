# LibreSolar KiCad footprint library

This library collects footprints used in the different Libre Solar designs.

It can be included into a project in two ways:

- Global library named `LibreSolar`.
- Project-specific library named `LibreSolar`. This repository should ideally be included into the project as a git submodule.

## 3D models

Most 3D models were downloaded from the manufacturer website and cannot be made available due to license restrictions.

If you download them manually, place them into a folder of your choice with a subfolder `LibreSolar.3dshapes` and point the environment variable `LIBRESOLAR_3DMODEL_DIR` to this folder.
